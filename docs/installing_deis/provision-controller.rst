Provision a Controller
======================

The `controller` is the brains of a Deis platform. Provisioning a Deis
controller is a matter of creating one or more :ref:`concepts_coreos`
machines and installing a few necessary *systemd* units to manage
Docker containers.

Anywhere you can run CoreOS, you can run Deis, including most cloud
providers, virtual machines, and bare metal. See the
`CoreOS documentation`_ for more information on how to get set up
with CoreOS.

Amazon EC2
----------

The `contrib/ec2` section of the Deis project includes shell scripts,
documentation, and a customized CloudFormation template to make it easy
to provision a multi-node Deis cluster on `Amazon EC2`_.

Please see `contrib/ec2`_ for details on using Deis on Amazon EC2.

Rackspace
---------

The `contrib/rackspace` section of the Deis project includes shell
scripts, documentation, and a cloud-config template to make it easy to
provision a multi-node Deis cluster on Rackspace_ cloud.

Please see `contrib/rackspace`_ for details on using Deis on
Rackspace cloud.

DigitalOcean
------------

The `contrib/digitalocean` section of the Deis project includes shell
scripts and documentation to make it easy to provision a multi-node
Deis cluster on DigitalOcean_.

Please see `contrib/digitalocean`_ for details on using Deis on DigitalOcean.

Google Compute Engine
---------------------

The `contrib/gce`_ folder of the Deis project includes a Python script and
documentation to help get up and running with a multi-node Deis cluster on
`Google Compute Engine`_.

Please see the `Google Compute Engine`_ documentation for more details on
using Deis with Google Compute Engine.

Bare Metal
----------

The `contrib/bare-metal` section of the Deis project includes documentation in
README.md to help with provisioning a multi-node cluster on your own hardware.

Please see `contrib/bare-metal`_ for details on using Deis on bare metal.

Vagrant
-------

The root of the Deis project includes documentation in README.md, a
Makefile and a Vagrantfile to make it easy to provision a single- or
multi-node Deis cluster on Vagrant_ virtual machines.

Please see README.md_ for details on using Deis with Vagrant.
